Binary search and insertion way. (with deque)

Main Idea:
    Okay, the binary search and insertion method (sol1.py) was not efficient
    enough due to the insertion overhead, which is O(n). How about using
    `collections.deque`? It is implemented by the double linked list, so it
    would be beneficial than using just `list` type.

Time Complexity:
    addNum: O(n) --------> (?)
    findMedian: O(n)

    The insertion is still O(n)-ish. Since we need Î˜(n/2) for each access.
    Furthermore, we need n/2 time for returning median.
    Therefore, this method is worse than the first solution (using `list` type)
